## Exercise 1

My student number is:
2210426
vvxyzki

* What is the usable (host) address range of 192.168.ki.0/24? What is the broadcast address? What is the subnet address?
The IP addresses based on this are 10.10.04.0/24 (i.e. 10.10.4.0/24 since the 0 isn't needed) and 192.168.26.0/24 (1100 0000.1010 1000.0001 1010.0000 0000 in binary).
The subnet mask of the address is /24 (1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.0000 0000 in binary, and 225.225.225.000 in decimal). This means there are 8 bits left for creating subnests, ranging from 0000 0000 to 1111 1111. This is a total of 2^h - 2 = 254 possible host addresses, with 0000 0000 (0 in decimal, resulting in 192.168.26.0) being the subnet address and 1111 1111 (255 in decimal, resulting in 192.168.26.255) being the broadcast address. The resulting usable address range would be from 192.168.26.1 - 192.168.26.254.

My calculation:

## Exercise 2

* Divide the 192.168.ki.0/24 into smaller subnets with (atleast) 50 hosts in each. Notice! Make as small of a subnet/subnets as you can!

/24 has 8 bits available for host addresses:

2^8 = 256 addresses
2^7 = 128 addresses
2^6 = 64 addresses
2^5 = 32 addresses

Each subnet should have at least 50 hosts, meaning that 6 host bits (i.e. /26) is the best-fitting option with still room to add more addresses later. Since there are always 8 bits available, that means there are 2 leftover bits in this case, which could be 00, 01, 10 or 11 resulting in 4 smaller subnets with 64 addresses each:

## Exercise 3

* Divide the 10.xy.yz.0/24 into smaller subnets:
- The subnets have to be as small as possible (usable hosts)
- The subnets must have the capability to support 13 hosts in each of the subnets

My address is 10.10.4.0/24. As before, I'll calculate the number of possible host addresses per subnet:

2^5 = 32 addresses
2^4 = 16 addresses
2^3 = 8 addresses

4 host bits (h) are needed, which equals /28. There will be 2^4 = 16 different subnets with 16 addresses per subnet, since 4 bits are available for creating subnets.

subnet mask
ssss ssss . ssss ssss . ssss ssss . ssss hhhh
1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 0000 / 28 (binary)
   255    .    255    .    255    . 240            (decimal)
   
   
Here I will show some of the subnet tables, but I haven't written out all of them. I was already familiar with binary and I feel like I understand the concept well enough already.
(If I did make a mistake here, please feel free to make me write down all tables several times as a lesson)

subnet 1:
ssss | hhhh
0000 |0000   .0 (Network address)
0000 |0001   .1 (1st IP host address)
0000 |0010   .2
...
...
0000 |1101   .13
0000 |1110   .14 (last IP host address)
0000 |1111   .15 (Broadcast address)


subnet 2:
ssss |hhhh
0001 |0000   .16 (Network address)
0001 |0001   .17 (1st IP host address)
0001 |0010   .18
...
...
0001 |1101   .29
0001 |1110   .30 (last IP host address)
0001 |1111   .31 (Broadcast address)

etc. until
subnet 15:
ssss |hhhh
1110 |0000   .224 (Network address)
1110 |0001   .225 (1st IP host address)
1110 |0010   .226
...
...
1110 |1101   .237
1110 |1110   .238 (last IP host address)
1110 |1111   .239 (Broadcast address)

subnet 16:
ssss |hhhh
1111 |0000   .240 (Network address)
1111 |0001   .241 (1st IP host address)
1111 |0010   .242
...
...
1111 |1101   .253
1111 |1110   .254 (last IP host address)
1111 |1111   .255 (Broadcast address)



## Exercise 4

* Divide the last subnet, of from exercise 3, into smaller subnets:
- The subnets have to be as small as possible (usable hosts)
- The subnets must have the capability to support 2 hosts in each of the subnets


The last subnet from exercise 3 ranges from 10.10.4.240 - 10.10.4.255.

2^3 = 8 addresses
2^2 = 4 addresses
2^1 = 2 addresses


2 host bits (h) are needed to have 2 usable host addresses, which equals /30. There will be 2^2 = 4 different subnets with 4 addresses per subnet, since 2 bits are available for creating subnets.

subnet mask
ssss ssss . ssss ssss . ssss ssss . ssss hhhh
1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1100 / 30 (binary)
   255    .    255    .    255    . 252            (decimal)
   


subnets of subnet 16:
ssss ss | hh
1111 00 | 00   .240 (Network address)
1111 00 | 01   .241 (1st IP host address)
1111 00 | 10   .242 (last IP host address)
1111 00 | 11   .242 (Broadcast address)

1111 01 | 00   .242 (Network address)
1111 01 | 01   .242 (1st IP host address)
1111 01 | 10   .242 (last IP host address)
1111 01 | 11   .242 (Broadcast address)

1111 10 | 00   .242 (Network address)
1111 10 | 01   .242 (1st IP host address)
1111 10 | 10   .242 (last IP host address)
1111 10 | 11   .242 (Broadcast address)

1111 11 | 00   .242 (Network address)
1111 11 | 01   .242 (1st IP host address)
1111 11 | 10   .254 (last IP host address)
1111 11 | 11   .255 (Broadcast address)



## Exercise 5

* Is subnet 10.xy.yz.0/24 a part of the supernet 10.xy.16.0/20? Write your calculations on paper or do them on the computer. Add the calculations to the documentation (e.g. take a picture of the paper or screenshot).

My conclusion is that subnet 10.xy.yz.0/24 (10.10.4.0/24) is indeed a part of supernet 10.xy.16.0/20 (10.10.16.0/20):
![Calculation of exercise 5](/documentation/E03/exercise5.jpeg)

This exercise gave me some trouble, until I found this explanation on a forum (see the accepted solution): [How to find a supernet address](https://community.cisco.com/t5/routing/how-to-find-supernet-address/td-p/3014963)


## Exercise 6

* Is subnet 10.xy.yz.0/24 (10.10.4.0/24) a part of supernet 10.0.0.0/8? Write your calculations on paper or do them on the computer. Add the calculations to the documentation (e.g. take a picture of the paper or screenshot).


This calculation shows the first step in the calculation that shows if subnet 10.10.4.0/24 is a part of supernet 10.0.0.0/8. 
![Calculation of exercise 6](/documentation/E03/exercise6a.jpeg)


The subnet 10.10.0.0/24 is proven to exist. Now we keep on looking to see if 10.10.4.0/24 exists. Based on my calculations it seems that it indeed does. I'm not sure if I did the calculations 100% correctly, as I think I don't yet understand properly how to determine the correct subnet mask myself. I did what I think is correct:

## Your own IP addresses

1 Go to https://www.ripe.net
2 Copy & paste the IP after __Your IP address is:__ to the search box
3 Investigate and document the results

I can see from what company my internet contract is, and that it's based in Finland. It says RIPE as well, meaning it's a European/Middle-Eastern IP address. After clicking on __admin-c__ I got the name and address of someone in Helsinki, the address is of an office space. It seems that this person used to be software architect at DNA in 2000-2004, which is the only link I can find that makes sense. Currently, he works at Fruugo, which seems to be unrelated to internet connections. The dates included in the report don't have any link to the date that we got this internet connection, so maybe that's dates of certificates or something:

## Internet Registries

* Fill the following addresses with your student number: 195.xy.yz.0/24, 43.xy.ki.0/24, 15.ki.xy.0/24 and 100.yz.ki.0/24. Search to whom they are registered to. Search through the RIRs.

195.xy.yz.0/24: 195.10.4.0/24
43.xy.ki.0/24: 43.10.26.0/24
15.ki.xy.0/24: 15.26.10.0/24
100.yz.ki.0/24: 100.4.26.0/24

I found it very convenient that whenever I entered an IP address, some of the websites, though not all, would tell me to what RIR the address belonged, e.g. ARIN or RIPE.
