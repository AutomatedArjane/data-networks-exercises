I installed a virtual machine! Isn't it great?

MAC-address: '080027EF473E'

* What is this virtual machine useful for without a network connection? What can you do with it?
You can run all kinds of offline programs so that you are extra sure that you don’t accidentally affect other computers in a network. Also if you accidentally break something on your virtual computer, your actual computer is still fine. This is especially important in cyber security and white-hat hacking. \(also in grey- and black-hat hacking but I’m assuming we talk about legal things here :\)

* Is there any point in computers without network connectivity?
Absolutely, you can run all kinds of offline programs like games, text editing programs, edit pictures and videos, etc. etc. etc. When I was a child, our computer at home had no internet \(that I knew of\).

* hint: Lookup what Alan Turing did without the Internet
I already knew about him, and I admire this man. Very briefly: his decrypting skills/machines were beyond amazing, which helped save many lives, and he came to a horrible end :\(


I tried to ping a link, but I didn't have an internet connection. I changed the network settings of my virtual machine to NAT, so a WiFi-connection could be established, and then the pinging worked:

The results of the traceroute command and the traceroute resolve command, which unfortunately didn't show any names or other information \(I think it shows names sometimes?\). None of the lines show anything else but the number and three asterisks:
