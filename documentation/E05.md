## Creating and setting up VyOS2 and Lubuntu3

I cloned VyOS1 and Lubuntu2, and made sure their cabling is set up correctly in the network settings, according to my drawings:

My physical topology:

My logical topology:

The configuration of VyOS2, including static routing and DHCP:

VyOS2 ip route:

The configuration of VyOS1, including static routing and DHCP:

Now I'll have the Lubuntus ping each other, with the new dynamic 
ip addresses. This doesn't go quite as planned yet. Lubuntu1 and 3
can indeed ping each other, but any pings involving Lubuntu2 fail.
I'll have to find out why this is, I guess it's something in my
DHCP settings?
