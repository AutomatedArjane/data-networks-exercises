## Creating and setting up VyOS2 and Lubuntu3

I cloned VyOS1 and Lubuntu2, and made sure their cabling is set up correctly in the network settings, according to my drawings:

My physical topology:

The configuration of VyOS2, including static routing and DHCP (after correction, see below):

VyOS2 ip route:

Now I'll have the Lubuntus ping each other, with the new dynamic 
ip addresses. This doesn't go quite as planned yet. Lubuntu1 and 3
can indeed ping each other, but any pings involving Lubuntu2 fail.
I'll have to find out why this is, I guess it's something in my
DHCP settings? I'll continue with this assignment at a later moment.
These are the commands I used (updated with fixes, I accidentally 
called all network-names lubuntu3 instead of workstations and dandelion):

```
THESE ROWS WENT TO VYOS2
lubuntu3:
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu3 subnet 192.168.26.128/26 default-router 192.168.26.129
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu3 subnet 192.168.26.128/26 range PCs start 192.168.26.135
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu3 subnet 192.168.26.128/26 range PCs stop 192.168.26.145


THESE ROWS WENT TO VYOS1
workstations:
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name workstations subnet 192.168.26.0/26 default-router 192.168.26.62
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name workstations subnet 192.168.26.0/26 range PCs start 192.168.26.5
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name workstations subnet 192.168.26.0/26 range PCs stop 192.168.26.10

dandelion:
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name dandelion subnet 192.168.26.64/26 default-router 192.168.26.126
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name dandelion subnet 192.168.26.64/26 range PCs start 192.168.26.75
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name dandelion subnet 192.168.26.64/26 range PCs stop 192.168.26.85
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I was clearly tired when I stopped working on this assignment, because so far
I'm fixing it quite fast. I learned from E04 that I should carefully check everything
systematically, and after systematically pinging different machines, routers and switches
it turns out I hadn't placed all "roadsigns" on the routers yet. Once I started doing
that, the pings to the switches (10.10.4.1 - 10.10.4.3) started to go through! Though
on Lubuntu2 these still didn't work for some reason. I can't even ping 192.168.26.126,
which should be Lubuntu2's gateway address.

Next step: I checked what the actual gateway addresses were, and realised both Lubuntu1 and Lubuntu2 had
the same one (.62). I realised I configured the dynamic ip addresses wrong (see DHCP commands). Once
that was fixed, I managed to get the correct gateway addresses, and I could ping between all Lubuntu machines:
