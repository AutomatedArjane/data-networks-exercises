My physical topology:

My logical topology:
![Logical topology](/documentation/E04/Logical_topology.png)



I created a virtual router and connected them to the network through switch 1:
* ![Switch-vyos connection PoV Switch](/documentation/E04/Switch-vyos-connection-PoV-Switch.PNG)
* ![Switch-vyos connection PoV vyos](/documentation/E04/Switch-vyos-connection-PoV-vyos.PNG)


Then, I tagged the connections to and from the switches, keeping in mind that the vyos router is connected to switch 1:
* ![Port configuration switch 1](/documentation/E04/Switch1_ports.PNG)
* ![Port configuration switch 2](/documentation/E04/Switch2_ports.PNG)

I configured the connections in the VyOS:
![Vyos connections](/documentation/E04/Vyos_connections.PNG)
![Testing the vyos port](/documentation/E04/Testing_vyos_port.PNG)

Whenever I change the IP addresses of my Lubuntu 1 and Lubuntu 2 to the ones I 
calculated (192.168.26.1 and 192.168.26.65), the machines can't ping each other. 
As long as they are on the same subnet (192.168.26.1 and 192.168.26.2), it works.
I use these addresses as a workaround, because otherwise I'm unable to continue
with the assignments:
![Creative IP addresses](/documentation/E04/Creative_IP_addresses.PNG)

I adjusted the Vyos settings accordingly:
![Creative IP addresses on VyOS](/documentation/E04/Creative_IP_addresses_vyos.PNG)
![VyOS interfaces and IP route](/documentation/E04/Vyos_interfaces.PNG)

Then I changed the default gateway address of both Lubuntu machines to the VyOS 
interface address. The pinging worked, but this broke as soon as I tried to change
the Lubuntu 2 IP address to 192.168.26.65:

After asking help from a teacher I heard my physical topology drawing was correct 
but my vlan configurations / tags were not. After several hours of comparing my 
drawing to my configurations and re-listening parts of lectures I managed to 
get the connections finally working! Victory!
My new configurations:
![New configurations](/documentation/E04/Switch_conf.PNG)

I feel like the pinging takes a bit long, but due to my limited experience in this I'm not sure.
The laptop I'm using is quite old and worn, so that could be a reason for it. It behaves a bit
oddly even during normal use. The pinging and traceroute commands:
![Working ping](/documentation/E04/Working_ping.PNG)

I added ip addresses to the switches and set the gateway address in each switch. 
Pinging the switches from the Lubuntu machines was then successful, the switches'
configuration is also visible:
![Pinging switches](/documentation/E04/Pinging_switches.PNG)

Then I accessed the switches from the Lubuntu machines using SSH:

The new switch configurations:
